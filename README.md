## The Learning Experience
One of the first things I realized is, I am far from having
an excellent taste in UI design. While I have done some Photoshop
and illustrator, I see that I had never had to really think about
typefaces, font sizes relative to other fonts on the page, 
line-height and margins, dark background color schemes, the number of
characters on a line, etc. I still love UI design and admire those
with a good taste for it. I will keep reading web design articles
subscriptions to and learn about web design from experienced designers
At the same time, I still find I love the user experience, but there
is always so much to do when working on a website like this from 
scratch, that I cannot get to it all.

Since there was always so much to do, a few weeks in I realized 
I had lost focus of reaching an end. I was working and whatever
feature came to mind next, but not trying to push out a minimum 
viable product. I was able to get a hold of myself and shift 
priorities to get important parts done. The product may not be
pretty or in it's final, glorious form I want it to be in, but
I needed to learn to move on and accept coming back to it later.
